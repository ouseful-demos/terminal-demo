If the browser tab running the applicaiton is closed, a new browser tab can be opened and the URL from which the application was installed can be opened *without the need to make a request from the original website*. That is, the page will open from the locally installed version of the application, without the need for an internet connection to the original website.\n\nFiles saved in the environment are saved to browser storage, which means that if the environment is accessed *from the same browser on the same computer*, previously saved files will remain available even if the computer on which the user is working is shutdown and restarted, the browser reopened and the website reloaded.",
