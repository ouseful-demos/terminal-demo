For example:\n\n$t=\\dfrac{d}{s}$\n\nwhere $t$ stands for time, $d$ for distance and $s$ for speed. (Italics are traditionally used for quantities expressed in letters, so the typesetting system I have used renders those quantities using italics here.)\n\nAs I have already mentioned, if you need to work out how long a radio signal takes to travel between two points, you will need to use the equation\n\n${time}=\\dfrac{distance}{speed}$\n\nto help you. You will need to put in specific values for the distance and the speed in order to calculate the time. This process is known as __substitution__ into the equation.\n\nThus if you need to work out how long a signal takes to travel 900 metres you will need to substitute 900 for the distance. The speed is $3 \\times 10^8$ metres per second, so you need to substitute $3 \\times 10^8$ for the speed. You don’t need to worry about the units – that is, the metres and the metres per second – *provided* you check that they are mutually compatible. Here they are, because the distance is expressed in *metres* and the speed in *metres* per second. Further, the fact that the speed is in metres per *second* tells you that the time value that will emerge will be in seconds.\n\nThus the value of the time in seconds will be\n\n${time}= \\dfrac{ 900 }{ 3 \\times 10^8 } = \\dfrac{ 9 \\times 10^2 }{ 3 \\times 10^8 } = \\dfrac{9}{3} \\times \\dfrac{10^2}{10^{-6}} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}$",
