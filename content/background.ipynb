We also need to mitigate against the risk of side effects, such as changing default paths or settings associated with previously installaed environments: ideally, we donl't want to break anything already installed on the student's computer, and we don't want any of their packages to interfere with ours. Students should also be able to cleanly remove any software installed as part of their studies without disrpupting any other software installations.\n\nIf we provide a hosted solution for students to access, we need to cover the costs of providing the service, manage the risks associated with students running arbitrary code on hosted servers, provide some way of accommodating persistent file storage, as well as requiring students to have a network connection in order to access the hostd service.\n",

Debugging uisng breakpoints, for example, is not considered.\n\n",
